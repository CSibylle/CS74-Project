function lik = q2_loglik(Xtrain, Ytrain, theta)
% Computes the log likelihood value for training data (Xtrain, Ytrain) and parameter theta

% INPUT
%  Xtrain  : [m x n] matrix, where each row is a n-dimensional input example (assume it 
%            already contains the constant feature set to 1)
%  Ytrain  : [m x 1] vector, where the i-th element is the correct label
%                    for the i-th example
%  theta   : [n x 1] vector, the current model parameters

% OUTPUT
%  lik     : [1 x 1] scalar, the computed log likelihood
